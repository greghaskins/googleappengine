Google App Engine Java Runtime SDK - Contacts API Demo

The Contacts API demo illustrates how to use the Google APIs to access your
contacts data.

The demo focuses on three areas:

    * Authenticating using AuthSub - See AuthSubManager.java for the related
      code.
    * Loading contacts from the Contacts API - See home.jsp for the related
      code.
    * Loading binary data from the Google Contacts API - See
      ShowImageServlet.java for the related code

This example should give you a sense of how to use the Google Data APIs from
end-to-end.

To get all of the dependencies on a Mac OS X, Linux, or other Unix derived
system, you can use the following commands:

wget http://gdata-java-client.googlecode.com/files/gdata-samples.java-1.30.0.java.zip
unzip gdata-samples.java-1.30.0.java.zip
cp gdata/java/lib/gdata-*.jar ./war/WEB-INF/lib/.
