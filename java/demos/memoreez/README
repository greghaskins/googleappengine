Google App Engine Java Runtime SDK - memoreez Demo

memoreez is a simple memory game -- users are shown several rows of cells and
must repeatedly select pairs of cells until they find two with the same
color. The color-to-box mapping is stored in the datastore and cached using
memcache.

An administrator interface for generating a new color-to-box mapping is also
provided.
