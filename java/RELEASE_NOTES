- The XMPP API was updated to include presence and allow subscriptions.
- The Task Queue now supports programmatic deleting of tasks.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2588
- The maximum rate per queue at which tasks are processed has been increased to
  100 task per second.
- The maximum number of concurrent requests for a single queue can be specified
  in the application's queue.xml. This provides an additional easy-to-use form
  of rate limiting. The current number of running tasks is also displayed in
  the Admin Console.

- Admin Console logs viewer now displays time as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm.

  release.

  of new queues and the number of disabled queues exceeds 100.
- Added a putIfUntouched() method to the Memcache API.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2139

  Queue.

Version 1.4.1
=============
There were no updates to the Java SDK for the 1.4.1 App Engine release.

Version 1.4.0
=============
- The Always On feature allows applications to pay and keep 3 instances of their
  application always running, which can significantly reduce application
  latency.
- Developers can now enable Warmup Requests. By specifying  a handler in an
  app's appengine-web.xml, App Engine will attempt to send a Warmup Request to
  initialize new instances before a user interacts with it. This can reduce the
  latency an end-user sees for initializing your application.
- The Channel API is now available for all users.
- Task Queue has been officially released, and is no longer an experimental
  feature. The API import paths that use 'labs' have been deprecated. Task queue
  storage will count towards an application's overall storage quota, and will
  thus be charged for.
- The deadline for Task Queue and Cron requests has been raised to 10 minutes.
  Datastore and API deadlines within those requests remain unchanged.
- For the Task Queue, developers can specify task retry-parameters in their
  queue.xml.
- Apps that have enabled billing are allowed up to 100 queues with the Task
  Queue API.
- Metadata Queries on the datastore for datastore kinds, namespaces, and entity
  properties are available.
- URL Fetch allowed response size has been increased, up to 32 MB. Request size
  is still limited to 1 MB.
- The request and response sizes for the Images API have been increased to
  32 MB.
- The total size of Memcache batch operations is increased to 32 MB. The 1 MB
  limit on individual Memcache objects still applies.
- The attachment size for outgoing emails has been increased from 1 MB to 10 MB.
  The size limit for incoming emails is still 10 MB. 
- Size and quantity limits on datastore batch get/put/delete operations have
  been removed. Individual entities are still limited to 1 MB, but your app may
  batch as many entities together for get/put/delete calls as the overall
  datastore deadline will allow for.
- When iterating over query results, the datastore will now asynchronously
  prefetch results, reducing latency in many cases by 10-15%.
- The Admin Console Blacklist page lists the top blacklist rejected visitors.
- The automatic image thumbnailing service supports arbitrary crop sizes up to
  1600px.
- Overall average instance latency in the Admin Console is now a weighted
  average over QPS per instance.
- Added a low-level AysncDatastoreService for making calls to the datastore
  asynchronously.
- Added a getBodyAsBytes() method to QueueStateInfo.TaskStateInfo, this returns
  the body of the task state as a pure byte-string.
- The whitelist has been updated to include all classes from javax.xml.soap.
- Fixed an issue sending email to multiple recipients.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1623
- Revert the default logging level during GWT hosted mode back to INFO.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4011
- Fixed an issue with OpenId over SSL.
  http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3393

Version 1.3.8
=============
- You can run task queue tasks immediately from the admin console.
- Added an OutputSettings class to the Images API to specify the JPEG encoding
  quality when running in production.
- Support for login of multiple Google accounts within an app, and longer login
  sessions. For more information see:
    http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599
- In queue.xml, the maximum allowed bucket size is now 100.
- Removed limits on zigzag merge-join queries. Therefore the error "The built-in
  indices are not efficient enough for this query and your data. Please add a
  composite index for this query." will no longer be thrown in most cases,
  enabling more types of queries without indexes.
- The whitelist has been updated to include java.net.InetAddress and some
  interfaces and abstract classes in javax.xml.soap, including
  javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage.
- Fixed an issue reserving App Ids by owners of emails containing periods,
  multiple cases, and googlemail.com address.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1196
- Fixed an issue where TaskOptions had no public getters, making testing
  impossible.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3243
- Fixed an issue on the development server where PNGs were being returned as
  JPEGs.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3661
