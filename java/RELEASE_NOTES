Version 1.2.8
=============
  - Support for JAXB. JAXB is included in JDK 1.6 (and App Engine's production
    servers). If you're using JDK 1.5 with your local dev_appserver, you will
    need to include the JAXB libraries with your application to use it.

  - New support for application pre-compilation to reduce the length of
    loading requests. To enable pre-compilation on your application, add this
    flag to your appengine-web.xml: 
      <precompilation-enabled>true</precompilation-enabled>     
    If you have trouble deploying your application, you should remove this 
    flag or set it to false.
  - Added Quota API (com.google.appengine.api.quota) to match Python API.
  - Low-level Memcache API now supports batchIncrement().
  - HTTPResponse object now has getFinalUrl() method for 302 redirects.

    following flag when starting the server:

  - Additional file extensions permitted when sending mail.
